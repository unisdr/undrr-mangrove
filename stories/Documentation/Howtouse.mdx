# How to Use Mangrove

This guide explains how to use the UNDRR Mangrove component library in your projects.

## Integration Methods

There are two main ways to use Mangrove components:

### 1. Direct HTML/CSS/JS Integration

* Include the base styling CSS file in your project 
* Browse the component catalog and select what you need
* Check the component's documentation page
* Copy the HTML structure from the component's code tab
* Add the referenced CSS and JS files to your project as specified in the documentation

### 2. React Component Integration

TBD

## Framework Agnostic Design System

Mangrove is designed to be framework agnostic, meaning it can work seamlessly with nearly any existing system. This approach offers maximum flexibility and ease of integration across various projects and technologies.

Key features of our framework-agnostic approach:

* **Minimal dependencies**: Our design system avoids reliance on specific frameworks or libraries to prevent conflicts with your existing projects.
* **Namespaced code**: All JavaScript and CSS code is namespaced with `mg-` to prevent conflicts with your existing codebase.
* **Easy integration**: You can easily incorporate our design system into your project, regardless of the framework or technology stack you're using.
* **Consistent design**: The design system maintains a consistent look and feel across different implementations by focusing on repeatable HTML structures.

## CSS File References

Include the appropriate CSS file based on your project needs:

```html
<!-- Base styling -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unisdr.github.io/undrr-mangrove/css/style-gutenberg.css">

<!-- Theme-specific styling (choose one) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unisdr.github.io/undrr-mangrove/css/style-preventionweb.css">
<!-- or -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unisdr.github.io/undrr-mangrove/css/style-undrr.css">
```

## Development Setup

If you want to contribute to the Mangrove component library, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/unisdr/undrr-mangrove.git
cd undrr-mangrove
```

2. Use Docker for development (recommended)
```bash
# Start the application, runs Storybook locally on port 6006
yarn docker-run
```

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use Docker:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run Storybook locally
yarn run storybook
```

3. Building the project
```bash
# Using Docker
yarn docker-build

# Without Docker
yarn run build
```

4. Testing
```bash
# Run tests
yarn test

# Run with coverage report
yarn test:coverage
```

5. Linting
```bash
# Run linting
yarn run lint
```

## Assets Location

* **Components**: Available in the `dist/components` directory
* **CSS files**: Available in the `dist/assets/css` directory
* **Icons and images**: Available in the `dist/assets/images` directory
* **Web fonts**: Available in the `dist/assets/fonts` directory

## Component HTML Structure

Each component has a consistent HTML structure that should be maintained:

1. Each component uses the `mg-` prefix in its class names
2. Semantic HTML elements are used where appropriate
3. ARIA attributes are included for accessibility

Example component structure:

```html
<div class="mg-component">
  <div class="mg-component__element">
    <!-- Component content -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Credits
