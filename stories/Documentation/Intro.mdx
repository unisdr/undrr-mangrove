# Welcome

The purpose of this project is to act as a test to see if it is a suitable base for UNDRR's needs.

By unifying design elements into reusable components, development is simplified, accelerated and more reliable. Serving the interests of the organisation and users.

## 🚨 Pre-alpha warning 🚨

This project is under active development and at the moment provides no useful resources. [Internal notes on the project can be seen in the GitLab Wiki](https://git.un.org/undrr/web-backlog/-/wikis/Mangrove:-the-UNDRR-Component-library).

## Purpose

This project stops short of being a full design system and instead focus on providing usable components that are informed by the UNDRR brand guidelines and project styles.

These components offer consistency, documentation and portability to speed quality development with the expected look and feel. These will also help reduce entropy, critical in ensuring websites remain accessible.

If there is a Component or Pattern that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact us in the issue queue.

## Process

The Guide is a living document created to meet the needs of UNDRR's front-end developers and designers. If there is a Component or Pattern that you need, or you have any other feedback, question or comment please contact us.

Components can be created and are also subject to updates and removal. These changes are documented -- if you'd like to request a new component, get in touch \[contact form to come].

### Structure

Mangrove uses a loose [atomic design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) approach, but major concepts are split as follows:

* Getting started: high level information on what Mangrove is, and what you should and shouldn't do
* Design decisions: colours, spacing, typography and so on.
* Components: the bread and butter of cards, buttons and so on.
* Templates (to come): high-level organisms that show a whole section layout or page

### Codebase

Code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/unisdr/undrr-mangrove) and through [a public Storybook website](https://unisdr.github.io/undrr-mangrove/).

Developers are encouraged to consume the project through the remotely available CSS to help ensure "up-to-date-ness".
