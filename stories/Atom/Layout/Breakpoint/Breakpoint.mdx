# Breakpoints

Sizes at which the content of the website adapts itself to device width.

## Note on supported screen sizes

Based on user analytics Mangrove takes a relatively conservative approach to widths. While there is value in offering designs that cater to larger screen sizes (1440px), the **1200px resolution** remains the key target. Testing and development efforts should prioritize this width to accommodate the largest possible portion of the user base without overextending resources.

1. **Desktop Users**:

   - **75% of users** are on desktop devices.
   - A small percentage of users access the site from tablets.

2. **Screen Widths**:
   - **5% of desktop users** are operating at screen widths of **1024px or less**.
   - **93% of users** can view content at **1200px width**.
   - **80% of users** can handle **1280px width**.
   - **55% of users** will see content at **1440px width**.

Data is [last updated in February 2023](https://gitlab.com/undrr/web-backlog/-/issues/667).
