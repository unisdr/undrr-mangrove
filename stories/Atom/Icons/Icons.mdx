# Icons

The Icon components grab attention and draw users into content, helping them quickly understand the context in which they are placed. 

Our legacy sites used the **FontAwesome** library, which is why we've maintained use the `.fa-` prefixes. 

## When to use:

- **Dense and Complex Content**: Use icons to help users comprehend available actions in complex interfaces.
- **Space Saving**: Replace words or long phrases with icons to save space without losing meaning.
- **Avoid Visual Clutter**: Use icons sparingly to prevent overwhelming the user with too many visual elements.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IconsStories.DefaultIcons} />
</Canvas>

## Usage

- **CSS-Based Icons**: For icons like `.fa.fa-rss`, apply these classes to a `<span>` element.
  
  ```html
  <span class="mg-icon fa-rss"></span>
  <span class="mg-icon fa-2x fa-rss"></span>
  ```

## Technical notes

- The font image files are located in the `\stories\assets\fonts\mangrove-icon-set` directory. Consult the accomponying README.md for information on updating.
- We use font icons because they provide a reliable way to integrate across our diverse ecosystem.
