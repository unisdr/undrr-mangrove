# Progress bar

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This component was part of the initial import from the UNDP implementation and is likely to be either heavily modified or deleted. It is not part of the current UNDRR distribution.

The Progress Bar is used to display an indicator showing the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar.

#### When to use:

- When a user page needs an indicator to be displayed on top of the page to show the length of scroll for a particular page.

### Formatting

#### Default

Progress bar can be used as reading meter where scrolling progress of the page is captured in the bar. In this case additional javascript initialization is required as explained below.

It has different color variations, which increase the length of the color based on the amount of scrolling done by the user.

<Canvas of={ProgressBarNavigationStories.DefaultProgressBar} meta={ProgressBarNavigationStories} />

### Usage

To use this component, follow these steps:

- Copy the HTML from the canvas
- Add it to your HTML page
- You should have loader-ready
