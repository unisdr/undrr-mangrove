# UNDRR logos

The UNDRR logo is a keystone element of the identity and is used to represent the entire organization.

### Overview

The UNDRR logo is the keystone element of the identity program and should be used to represent the entire organization.

When to use:

* To promote business.
* To create an identity for the organization.

### Formatting

#### Default

Within the design system, the logo is used in the header and footer components. The logo is available in blue or white.

### Content

A well-established and consistently presented identity is a very valuable asset. To protect and strengthen the trademark status of the logo, the approved versions must not be altered, modified, changed, or added to in any way.

<Anchor storyId="foundation-logos--undrr-logo-blue" />

### Blue logo

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LogoStories.UndrrLogoBlue} />
</Canvas>

<Anchor storyId="foundation-logos--undrr-logo-white" />

### White logo

Used when the logo is placed on a dark background.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LogoStories.UndrrLogoWhite} />
</Canvas>

### Square variants

The horizontal variant is preferred, but not always suitable. Therefore a "square" variation is available.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LogoStories.UndrrLogoSquareBlue} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LogoStories.UndrrLogoSquareWhite} />
</Canvas>

#### Interactions

* By clicking on the logo, the website is *always* redirected to the UNDRR.org homepage.
