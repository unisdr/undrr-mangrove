# Loader

(NOTE: This is yet to be adapated to the UNDRR system and styles.)

A loading spinner is a utility that shows a loading page overlay when clicking a link or button

### Overview

A loading spinner displays a loading page overlay to inform the user of some background activity happening in response to their action on a page. This helps the user understand that they need to wait for the activity to finish before proceeding further.

#### When to use:

* To inform the user that some background activity is happening when they encounter a delay in response to a button or link click

### Formatting

#### Default

The loading spinner is a simple animation that informs the user that the page is loading. It will be displayed until the full page has been loaded.

### Content

The loading spinner is a simple circle animation. The size varies depending on the screen size.

### Behaviors

#### States

The loading spinner has just one state - spinning. As soon as the page loads, the loading spinner is removed

<Canvas>
  <Story of={LoaderStories.DefaultLoader} />
