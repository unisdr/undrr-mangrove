The Tabs are used to navigate through the same groups of content.

### Overview

#### When to use:

To navigate through the same groups of content.

### Formatting

It consists of different tabs and a tab border.

### Content

There are two types of tabs: single tab and tab bar with wrapping.

1. Single tab:

2. Tab bar with wrapping:

### Behaviors

#### States

There are three states: Default, Hover, and Selected.

1. Default: It is the tab bar that is displayed when the page opens.

2. Hover: It changes appearance once the mouse hovers over it.

3. Selected: It is a selected state with a red horizontal line below it.

### Stacked Tabs

The stacked tabs variant displays the tabs vertically in an accordion-like layout.

### Usage:

* Copy the HTML from the HTML tab (Canvas) into your html file
* Initialize the tab function in document ready or window load by calling tabs() function.
* Optional: If you want to add left-right animation then add data-viewport=”true” attribute to your HTML element and include viewport.min.js.
* Add other resources in your html file given below

### Interactions

* Hover state appears to the entire tab.
* By clicking on the tab the particular tab opens.
