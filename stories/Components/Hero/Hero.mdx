# Mangrove hero (main)

The Mangrove Hero components are page sections with images and overlay colors for primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary variants.

## Overview

The Mangrove Hero component defines a section with an image, some text, and optional CTA buttons. It is highly customizable and can be styled in four different variants: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

### When to use:

Use this component when you want to display a prominent section with an image background, title, text, and optional action buttons.

## Example

This story shows the default Hero component with a link in the title.

<Canvas of={HeroStories.Default} meta={HeroStories} />

## Interactions

- Clicking on the title (if it has a link) or CTA buttons triggers the associated action (navigating to the link or executing a JavaScript function).

## Changelog

### Version 1.2 — Latest update

#### 1. Conditional rendering of headline

- If the `link` is present in the `data`, the title will be rendered as an `<a>` (anchor) tag.
- If no `link` is provided, the title will be rendered as an appropriate header tag (e.g., `<h1>`).

If the content has no link:

```jsx
<h1 class="text-xxl">Title without a link</h1>
```

If the content has a valid link:

```jsx
<a href="/#" class="text-xxl">
  Title with a link
</a>
```

#### 2. Support for HTML in title and summary fields

The `title` and `summaryText` fields now support the inclusion of HTML elements such as `<br>` (line breaks) and `&nbsp;` (non-breaking spaces) to allow more control over the formatting of the text.

```jsx
<span
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: 'This is a title with a<br>&nbsp;line break',
  }}
/>
```

### Version 1.1

- **Locale-based content with `getCaptionForLocale`**: The `Hero` component can now switch between different locales to display localized content.
- **Conditional headline rendering**: The headline now dynamically chooses between an anchor tag (`<a>`) and a header tag (`<h1>`) based on the presence of a `link`.
- **HTML support in text fields**: The `title` and `summaryText` fields now support raw HTML like `<br>` and `&nbsp;` for enhanced formatting control.

### Version 1.0 — Initial release

- Introduced the Mangrove Hero component with customizable background images, text, and CTA buttons.
