<Canvas>
  <Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LineVariantWhite} />
</Canvas>

### Without Attribution

<Canvas>
  <Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.WithoutAttribution} />
</Canvas>

## Alignment Options

The QuoteHighlight component supports three alignment options:

- `full`: Takes up the full width of its container (default)
- `left`: Aligns to the left, allowing content to flow around the right side
- `right`: Aligns to the right, allowing content to flow around the left side

### Left Aligned Quote

<Canvas>
  <Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LeftAlignedQuote} />
</Canvas>

### Left Aligned Quote with Portrait

<Canvas>
  <Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LeftAlignedQuoteWithPortrait} />
</Canvas>

### Right Aligned Quote

<Canvas>
  <Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.RightAlignedQuote} />
</Canvas>

### Right Aligned Quote with Portrait

<Canvas>
  <Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.RightAlignedQuoteWithPortrait} />
</Canvas>

## RTL Support

The QuoteHighlight component fully supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages. When used in an RTL context:

- Left-aligned quotes will appear on the right side of the content
- Right-aligned quotes will appear on the left side of the content
- The component's internal layout will automatically adjust for RTL reading direction

### RTL Example with Left Alignment (appears on right)

<Canvas>
  <Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.RTLLeftAlignedQuote} />
</Canvas>

### RTL Example with Right Alignment (appears on left)

<Canvas>
  <Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.RTLRightAlignedQuote} />
</Canvas>

## Design Guidelines

- Use the QuoteHighlight component to emphasize important quotes from key stakeholders.
- The line variant is more subtle and can be used within text content.
- The image variant is more prominent and works well as a standalone element.
- Choose background colors that complement the surrounding content.
- Always provide attribution when available to give proper credit to the source.
- Use the portrait image feature to add a personal touch to the quote.
- Ensure images are high quality and properly cropped to fit the designated space.
- Use alignment options to create more dynamic layouts:
  - Full width for standalone, prominent quotes
  - Left or right alignment to integrate quotes within text content
- For RTL languages, the component will automatically mirror its layout.
