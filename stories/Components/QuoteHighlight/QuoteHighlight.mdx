The `QuoteHighlight` component is used to display important quotes with attribution and optional images.

## Features

- Two layout variants: line (with separator line) or image (with side image)
- Three background color options: light, dark, and bright
- Optional attribution with name and title
- Optional portrait image that displays inline with attribution
- Optional side image for the image variant
- Three alignment options: full, left, and right
- RTL (Right-to-Left) language support
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Usage

```jsx
import { QuoteHighlight } from '@undrr/mangrove';

<QuoteHighlight
  quote="One doesn't have to look hard to find examples of how disasters are becoming worse."
  attribution="Mami Mizutori"
  attributionTitle="Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction"
  imageSrc="/assets/author.png"
  imageAlt="Mami Mizutori portrait"
  variant="line"
  backgroundColor="light"
  alignment="full"
/>
```

## Examples

### Line Variant (Default)

<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LineVariant} />

### Line Variant with Portrait Image

This variant shows the portrait image inline with the attribution.

<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LineVariantWithPortrait} />

### Image Variant

This variant displays a larger image to the side of the quote content.

<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.ImageVariant} />

### Dark Background

<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LineVariantDark} />

### Bright Background

<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LineVariantBright} />

### Without Attribution

<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.WithoutAttribution} />

## Alignment Options

The QuoteHighlight component supports three alignment options:

- `full`: Takes up the full width of its container (default)
- `left`: Aligns to the left, allowing content to flow around the right side
- `right`: Aligns to the right, allowing content to flow around the left side

### Left Aligned Quote

<div style={{ display: 'grid' }}>
{/* Grid container used to fix layout issues in demo page */}
<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LeftAlignedQuote} />
</div>


### Left Aligned Quote with Portrait

<div style={{ display: 'grid' }}>
{/* Grid container used to fix layout issues in demo page */}
<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.LeftAlignedQuoteWithPortrait} />
</div>

### Right Aligned Quote

<div style={{ display: 'grid' }}>
{/* Grid container used to fix layout issues in demo page */}
<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.RightAlignedQuote} />
</div>

### Right Aligned Quote with Portrait

<div style={{ display: 'grid' }}>
{/* Grid container used to fix layout issues in demo page */}
<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.RightAlignedQuoteWithPortrait} />
</div>

## RTL Support

The QuoteHighlight component fully supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages. When used in an RTL context:

- Left-aligned quotes will appear on the right side of the content
- Right-aligned quotes will appear on the left side of the content
- The component's internal layout will automatically adjust for RTL reading direction

### RTL Example with Left Alignment (appears on right)

<div style={{ display: 'grid' }}>
{/* Grid container used to fix layout issues in demo page */}
<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.RTLLeftAlignedQuote} />
</div>

### RTL Example with Right Alignment (appears on left)

<div style={{ display: 'grid' }}>
{/* Grid container used to fix layout issues in demo page */}
<Story of={QuoteHighlightStories.RTLRightAlignedQuote} />
</div>

## Design Guidelines

- Use the QuoteHighlight component to emphasize important quotes from key stakeholders.
- The line variant is more subtle and can be used within text content.
- The image variant is more prominent and works well as a standalone element.
- Choose background colors that complement the surrounding content.
- Always provide attribution when available to give proper credit to the source.
- Use the portrait image feature to add a personal touch to the quote.
- Ensure images are high quality and properly cropped to fit the designated space.
- Use alignment options to create more dynamic layouts:
  - Full width for standalone, prominent quotes
  - Left or right alignment to integrate quotes within text content
- For RTL languages, the component will automatically mirror its layout.
