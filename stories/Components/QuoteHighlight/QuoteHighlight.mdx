- Three background color options: light-blue, blue, and white
- Optional attribution with name and title
- Optional portrait image that displays inline with attribution
- Optional side image for the image variant
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

## Usage

```jsx
import { QuoteHighlight } from '@undrr/mangrove';

<QuoteHighlight

## Design Guidelines

- Use the QuoteHighlight component to emphasize important quotes from key stakeholders.
- The line variant is more subtle and can be used within text content.
- The image variant is more prominent and works well as a standalone element.
- Choose background colors that complement the surrounding content.
- Always provide attribution when available to give proper credit to the source.
- Use the portrait image feature to add a personal touch to the quote.
- Ensure images are high quality and properly cropped to fit the designated space.
