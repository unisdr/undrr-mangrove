# Snackbar

Snackbars provide brief notifications or feedback messages to users about an operation's status.
They appear temporarily at the top of the screen and automatically disappear after a set time.

## Overview

The Snackbar component is designed for displaying short, non-blocking notifications to users.
It's particularly useful for conveying status information without interrupting the user's workflow.

<Primary />
<Controls />

## Features

- **Multiple Severity Levels**: Supports error, warning, info, and success states with appropriate color coding and icons
- **Automatic Dismissal**: Disappears automatically after a configurable time
- **Manual Dismissal**: Can be dismissed by clicking the close button
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Supports keyboard navigation and can be dismissed with the Escape key
- **Screen Reader Support**: Enhanced for screen reader users with appropriate ARIA attributes
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Visual examples

### Error notification

<SnackbarPreview
  severity="error"
  message="An error occurred while processing your request"
/>

### Warning notification

<SnackbarPreview
  severity="warning"
  message="Your session will expire in 5 minutes"
/>

### Information notification

<SnackbarPreview
  severity="info"
  message="New updates are available for your application"
/>

### Success notification

<SnackbarPreview
  severity="success"
  message="Your changes have been saved successfully"
/>

## Interactive example

The example below shows an interactive Snackbar that you can show and hide with the button:

<Canvas>
  <Story of={SnackbarStories.Snackbar} />
</Canvas>

## How to use

### Basic implementation

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Snackbar from './path/to/Snackbar';

function MyComponent() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

  const handleClose = () => {
    setIsOpen(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}>Show Notification</button>

      <Snackbar
        severity="info"
        opened={isOpen}
        message="This is an informational message"
        onClose={handleClose}
        openedMiliseconds={5000}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Component props

| onClose           | function | -       | Callback function executed when the snackbar is closed (via button click or timeout)                                                    |
| openedMiliseconds | number   | -       | Duration in milliseconds before the snackbar automatically closes. If not provided, the snackbar will remain open until manually closed |

## Accessibility considerations

The Snackbar component follows accessibility best practices:

- Uses appropriate ARIA roles (`role="alert"`)
- Announces message severity for screen readers
- Supports keyboard navigation (close button is focusable)
- Can be dismissed with the Escape key
- Maintains sufficient color contrast for readability
- Auto-focuses the close button when opened for easy dismissal

## Mobile considerations

The component is designed to be fully responsive:

- Adapts to smaller screen sizes
- Provides larger touch targets on mobile devices
- Ensures buttons meet minimum size requirements (44px) for touch interactions
- Uses appropriate spacing for mobile viewports
