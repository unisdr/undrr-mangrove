# AI coding agent guidelines

> Edits to this file show up on both [GitHub](https://github.com/unisdr/undrr-mangrove/blob/main/docs/AI-CODING-AGENTS.md) and in [Storybook](https://unisdr.github.io/undrr-mangrove/?path=/docs/contributing-ai-coding-agent-guidelines--docs).

Practical guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) working on Mangrove. This covers the specific gaps between how human developers and AI agents approach code changes — the edge cases where an agent naturally drifts from the project's workflow.

Human developers absorb process by reading docs once and internalizing the habits. AI agents start fresh each session and tend to focus on the immediate code change, missing the surrounding process steps. This document bridges that gap.

## Before modifying any component

When you touch a component's JSX, SCSS, stories, or tests, read the [review checklist](REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md) **before committing**. The checklist is referenced in every component's MDX file, but agents typically don't read MDX until late in the process — by then the commit is already made.

Key items agents commonly miss:

- **Changelog entry** in the component's MDX file (date + what changed)
- **No `defaultProps`** — use destructured default parameters (deprecated in React 19)
- **BEM naming** with `mg-` prefix on all CSS classes
- **Story source examples** must match current class names (stale HTML in `parameters.docs.source.code` is invisible to tests but misleads consumers)
- **CSF3 format** for stories (no `Template.bind({})`)
- **Storybook imports**: use `import { Meta, Canvas } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'` — not `@storybook/blocks` (that package was removed in Storybook 9; this project is on Storybook 10)
- **Storybook links**: use `<LinkTo kind="..." story="...">` from `@storybook/addon-links/react` for prose story links. Never use `href="/?path=..."` or `href="?path=..."` — all MDX and stories render inside the preview iframe, so plain `<a href>` navigates the iframe directly, stripping the Storybook UI shell. For interactive navigation that also sets a global (e.g., theme-switching cards), use `linkTo` + `useGlobals` from `@storybook/preview-api` in an onClick handler — see the `StorybookNavCard` component in `stories/Documentation/Brand/components/` as a reference, and the [Component guide — Linking within Storybook docs](COMPONENT-GUIDE.md) section.

## Keeping the AI manifest in sync

The AI manifest (`scripts/ai-manifest/component-data.js` and `css-utilities.js`) is consumed by external AI agents to generate correct Mangrove markup. When you rename CSS classes, add components, or remove components, the manifest must be updated in the same commit.

Things to check:

- **Class names in `cssClasses` arrays** match the actual SCSS
- **HTML examples** use the current class names, not old ones
- **Deleted components** are removed from `component-data.js`
- **Descriptions** don't reference stale facts (e.g., "uses legacy class names" after a rename)

After changes, run `yarn build` to regenerate the compiled manifest and verify it.

## CSS class rename gotchas

Renaming CSS classes is a common task that creates subtle breakage because CSS failures are silent — elements just lose styling with no error. When renaming classes:

1. **Update both SCSS and JSX** in the same commit
2. **Search the full codebase** for the old class name (`grep -r` across `.scss`, `.jsx`, `.js`, `.mdx`, `.stories.jsx`)
3. **Check story source examples** — hardcoded HTML in `parameters.docs.source.code` blocks doesn't update automatically
4. **Check the AI manifest** — `scripts/ai-manifest/component-data.js` contains curated HTML examples
5. **Check compiled CSS** — after `yarn build` or `yarn scss`, verify old names are absent and new names are present in `stories/assets/css/style.css`
6. **Watch for SCSS nesting** — `.parent { &-child { } }` compiles to `.parent-child`; renaming the parent class requires flattening or adjusting the nesting

## Bare element selectors

Mangrove's BaseTypography SCSS files (`stories/Atom/BaseTypography/`) historically used bare HTML element selectors (`blockquote`, `cite`, `mark`, etc.) that style every instance globally. New additions or modifications to these files should scope styles to `.mg-body` to prevent leaking into non-Mangrove areas:

```scss
// Correct — scoped
.mg-body blockquote { ... }

// Avoid — global
blockquote { ... }
```

See [#865](https://github.com/unisdr/undrr-mangrove/issues/865) for the ongoing migration.

## Component quality checks with react-doctor

`react-doctor` is the project's component-quality linter. It bundles a curated set of correctness, performance, accessibility, and architecture rules that complement ESLint and `oxc`. Run it before submitting non-trivial component changes:

```sh
npx -y react-doctor@latest .
```

It prints a 0–100 health score, a categorised list of findings, and writes a full per-rule report to a temp directory. PRs #985, #987, #988, #989 systematically cleared the most mechanical findings (em-dashes, three-period ellipses, `defaultProps`, default `[]`/`{}` props, `useContext`, inline render helpers, etc.). Tracker issue [#986](https://github.com/unisdr/undrr-mangrove/issues/986) tracks remaining categories.

### House conventions enforced by react-doctor

Beyond standard React linting, these conventions have been codified through the audit. Future agents should follow them rather than re-introducing the patterns:

- **No em-dashes (`—`) in JSX text** — use parentheses, colons, semicolons, or commas. Em dashes read as model-output filler. *(Story names and UI labels follow the same rule.)*
- **No three-period ellipses (`...`) in JSX text** — use the typographic `…` (or `&hellip;`). Common in loading / init labels: `Loading…`, `Initialising search…`.
- **No `Component.defaultProps`** — use destructured default parameters. React 19 removes this for function components.
- **Prefer `use(Context)` over `useContext(Context)`** on React 19+. `use()` reads context conditionally inside branches, hooks, and loops; identical at top-level call sites.
- **Hoist default `[]` / `{}` props to module-level constants.** `function X({ items = [] })` creates a new array reference every render, breaking `useMemo` / `React.memo` consumer stability. Write `const EMPTY_ITEMS = []` at module scope and use `items = EMPTY_ITEMS`.
- **Extract inline render helpers as named components.** Arrow helpers like `const renderTitle = (item) => (…)` defined inside the component body get a new identity each render. Lift them to module scope (PascalCase) so React reconciles them as real components.
- **Lazy-init `useState` from computed values.** `useState(data.map(…))` re-runs the initializer every render — use `useState(() => data.map(…))`.
- **Always return a cleanup from `useEffect`** for `setTimeout` / `setInterval` / `addEventListener` / subscriptions. Anything that registers must unregister on re-run and unmount.

### Known false positives in this codebase

These rules fire but are not actionable as written. Don't churn on them:

- **`no-z-index-9999`** — the rule wants a 1–50 scale, but `_variables.scss` defines `$mg-z-index-modal: 5000` etc. by intent. Use the `$mg-z-index-*` tokens instead of raw numbers, accept that the rule will keep firing for tokenised values.
- **`iframe-has-title`** when `title={a || 'fallback'}` — the static analyzer can't see through the `||` fallback. Titles are present and valid.
- **`rendering-conditional-render`** flagged on identifiers prefixed with `show` / `is` (e.g. `showResultsCount`) — the rule infers from the variable name pattern and may fire on booleans.
- **`effect-needs-cleanup`** on d3 chart components that have no `setTimeout` / `addEventListener` in source — likely a d3-pattern false positive.

When you skip a finding, leave a one-line comment explaining why (or note it in the PR's *Out of scope* section) so the next agent doesn't re-investigate.

## Process differences: humans vs. agents

| What | Human developer | AI agent tendency | What the agent should do |
|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Review checklist | Reads once, internalizes | Doesn't read unless told | Read `docs/REVIEW-CHECKLIST.md` before committing component changes |
| Changelogs | Habit from past PRs | Skips unless prompted | Add a changelog entry to the component's MDX |
| Cross-file impact | Mentally tracks references | Focuses on the files being edited | `grep` for old names across all file types after renaming |
| Story source examples | Updates by habit | Doesn't notice stale static HTML | Check `parameters.docs.source.code` in `.stories.jsx` |
| AI manifest | Updates after code changes | Doesn't know it exists | Check `scripts/ai-manifest/component-data.js` and `css-utilities.js` |
| Compiled output | Inspects the result | Trusts the build succeeded | Verify class names in `stories/assets/css/style.css` after build |
| Z-index values | Knows the layer system | Uses raw numbers | Use `$mg-z-index-*` tokens for global stacking (fixed/sticky/portaled); derive backdrops with `$token - 1`; use raw values + comments for local stacking inside a component's own stacking context |
| Quality linter | Runs lint and tests | Skips additional component-quality checks | Run `npx -y react-doctor@latest .` after non-trivial changes; aim to leave the score equal or higher than where you found it |
