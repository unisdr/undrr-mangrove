# Writing quick reference

Use this as a compact, LLM‑friendly summary of the Mangrove Writing standards.

1. Improve UX — simplify flows, clarify actions, reduce friction.
2. Be truthful — avoid false urgency; state limits clearly; admit uncertainty.
3. Inclusive language — respect all users; avoid idioms/slang; ensure accessibility.
4. Context first — surface the most important info at the right moment.
5. Functional purpose — copy should guide, explain, or prevent errors.
6. Remove unnecessary words — if design alone works, skip text.
7. Consistency — same terminology, tone, and style everywhere.
8. Strong writing basics — active voice, plain language, clarity, rhythm.

Also:

- Sentence case for headings and titles; keep proper nouns and acronyms capitalized.
- Error messages: what happened, why (if known), what to do next.
- Empty states: what’s missing, why it matters, how to add content.
- Success messages: confirm result and suggest next steps.
- Confirmation dialogs: put consequences up front; primary action is the safest choice.

## Additions from style guides

- Use direct, plain language; front‑load key info; keep sentences short. (GOV.UK, PlainLanguage.gov)
- Descriptive link text; avoid “click here.” (GOV.UK)
- Sentence case for UI; keep proper nouns/acronyms capitalized. (Material Design)
- Calm, actionable errors: what happened, why (if helpful), what to do next. (NN/g)
- Inclusive language; avoid idioms/slang; meaningful alt text and link text. (Microsoft)
- Plan for localization: avoid idioms; allow text expansion; clear dates/times. (Microsoft, GOV.UK)

UN guidance:

- Use gender‑neutral terms by default (for example, “chair,” “spokesperson,” “humankind”). Avoid gender‑biased expressions and stereotypes. ([UN guidelines](https://www.un.org/en/gender-inclusive-language/guidelines.shtml))
- Make gender visible only when relevant; prefer neutral constructions (plural antecedents, “who,” or rephrasing). ([UN guidelines](https://www.un.org/en/gender-inclusive-language/guidelines.shtml))
- Consider translation and parity across UN languages; avoid constructions that impede translation. ([UN publications PDF](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4042358/files/1401388-EN.pdf))
- Disability‑inclusive (UN): ([PDF](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/4042358/files/1401388-EN.pdf))
